# Credit_card_fraud_detection
Credit card fraud detection uses machine learning to identify fraud by analyzing transaction patterns. Steps include data preprocessing, handling imbalances, model selection (e.g., logistic regression, random forests), and evaluation. This approach aids in preventing financial losses by detecting anomalies and enabling real-time prevention.
Credit card fraud detection is an essential application of machine learning in financial technology, as it helps in identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to building a credit card fraud detection system:

1. Data Collection
Use publicly available datasets, such as the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset containing anonymized credit card transactions with features like Time, V1-V28 (PCA components), Amount, and a target variable Class (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Imbalanced Data: Fraudulent transactions are often rare, creating a class imbalance problem. Techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling can help balance the dataset.
Scaling Features: Features like Amount and Time may need scaling for better performance, especially with algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.
Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into training and test sets, maintaining the fraud-to-non-fraud ratio.

3. Feature Engineering
Since the dataset is often anonymized, focus on deriving features from existing ones, like aggregating statistics (mean, standard deviation) over various time windows.

4. Model Selection
Logistic Regression: Simple, interpretable, and often effective for binary classification.

5. Evaluation Metrics
   Train_test_accuray: Using this evaluate the mode and find train-test-accuray of training data and testing data
imbalanced datasets.
7. Model Training
Train the chosen model(s) on the training dataset, carefully tuning hyperparameters for the best balance between recall (catching fraud cases) and precision (minimizing false alarms).
